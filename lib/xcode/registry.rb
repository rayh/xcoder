  # The Registry represents the parsed data from the Xcode Project file. Namely
  # the registry is a Hash that provides additional functionality to allow the 
  # the ability to query, add, and remove resources from the object hash.
  # 
  # Opening the Xcode project file in a text-editor you'll notice that it is a
  # big hash/plist with a file core keys. The most important key is the 'objects'
  # dictionary which maintains the master-list of Identifiers to properties. All 
  # objects are represented here and all other resources use the reference
  # to make the connection to the objects.
