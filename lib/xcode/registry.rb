  #
  # The Registry represents the parsed data from the Xcode Project file. The 
  # registry is a Hash that provides additional functionality to allow the 
  # the ability to query, add, and remove resources from the object hash.
  # 
  # Opening the Xcode project file in a text-editor you'll notice that it is a
  # big hash/plist. The registry represents this structure and provides access
  # to the top-level items: 'rootObject'; 'objectVersion'; 'archiveVersion' and 
  # 'objects'. The registry provides a number of methods to access these items.
  # 
  # The most important key is the 'objects' dictionary which maintains the 
  # master-list of Identifiers to properties. The registry provides additional
  # methods get, add, remove, and update the objects stored within it. The 
  # registry returns {Resource} objects which is a wrapper class around the 
  # properties hash that would normally be returned. Providing additional 
  # functionality to make it easier to traverse the project.

    # within Xcode. Here the `isa` string value is translated into a Ruby module.
    # 
    # Initially the `isa` values were mapped directly to Ruby modules but that
    # was changed to this model to make it easy to repair if Xcode were to 
    # change their `isa` values and also provide the ability to mixin different
    # functionality as needed.
