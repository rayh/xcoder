  #
  # Resources are not represented as a true entity within an Xcode project.
  # However when traversing through groups, targets, configurations, etc. you will 
  # find yourself interacting with these objects. As they represent a class that
  # acts as a shim around their hash data.
  # 
  # The goal of the {Resource} is to aid in the navigation through the project
  # and provide a flexible system to allow for Xcoder to adapt to changes to 
  # the Xcode project format.
  # 
  # A Resource requires an identifier and an instance of the {Registry}. Based
  # on the supplied identifier, it peforms a look up of it's properties or hash
  # of data. With that hash it then proceeds to create methods that allow for
  # easy read/write access to those property elements. This is similar to Ruby's
  # OpenStruct.
  #
  # @example Accessing the contents of a file reference
  # 
  #     file = project.file('IOSApp/IOSAppDelegate.m').properties # => 
  # 
  #     { 'isa' => 'PBXFileReference',
  #       'lastKnownFileType' => 'sourcecode.c.h',
  #       'path' => IOSAppDelegate.h', 
  #       'sourceTree' => "<group>" }
  # 
  #     file.isa # => 'PBXFileReference'
  #     file.last_known_file_type # => 'sourcecode.c.h'
  #     file.path # => 'IOSAppDelegate.m'
  #     file.path = "NewIOSAppDelegate.m" # => 'NewIOSAppDeleget.m'
  #     file.source_tree # => "<group>"
  #
  # In the above example, you can still gain access to the internal properties
  # through the {#properties} method. However, the {Resource} provides for you
  # additional ruby friendly methods to access the properties.
  # 
  # To provide additional convenience when traversing through the
  # various objects, the getter methods will check to see if the value
  # being returned matches that of a unique identifier. If it does, instead of
  # providing that identifier, it will instead look in the {Registry} for the 
  # object that matches and return a new Resource automatically.
  # 
  # @example Magically accessing resources through resources
  # 
  #     group = project.groups
  #     group.properties # =>
  # 
  #     { "children"=>["7165D45A146B4EA100DE2F0E", 
  #                    "7165D472146B4EA100DE2F0E", 
  #                    "7165D453146B4EA100DE2F0E", 
  #                    "7165D451146B4EA100DE2F0E"], 
  #       "isa"=>"PBXGroup", 
  #       "sourceTree"=>"<group>"}
  # 
  #     group.children.first # => 
  # 
  #     PBXGroup 7165D45A146B4EA100DE2F0E {"children"=>["7165D463146B4EA100DE2F0E", 
  #                                                     "7165D464146B4EA100DE2F0E", 
  #                                                     "7165D45B146B4EA100DE2F0E"], 
  #                                        "isa"=>"PBXGroup", 
  #                                        "path"=>"TestProject", 
  #                                        "sourceTree"=>"<group>"} 
  # 
  # In this example when accessing the first element of children instead of an
  # identifier string being returned the child resource is returned. This
  # functionality is in place to allow Xcoder to flexibly conform to new relationships 
  # that may exist or come to exist.
  # 
  # Lastly, a {Resource} is simply not enough to describe most of the objects
  # within an Xcode project as each object has unique functionality that needs 
  # to be able to perform. So each resource when it is created will query the
  # {Registry#isa_to_module} hash to determine the functionality that it needs
  # to additionally extend into the Resource.
  # 
  # This `isa` property mapped to Ruby modules allows for the easy expansion of
  # new objects or for changes to be made to existing ones as needed.
  #
