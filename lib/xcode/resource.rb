  #
  # Resources are not represented as a true entity within an Xcode project.
  # When traversing through groups, targets, configurations, etc. you will find
  # yourself interacting with these objects. As they represent a class that
  # acts as a shim around the hash data is parsed from the project.
  # 
  # A resource do some things that should be explained:
  # 
  # When a resource is created it requires an identifier and an instance of
  # of the Registry. It finds the properties hash of that given identifier 
  # within the registry and creates a bunch of read-only methods that allow for 
  # easy access to those elements. This is not unlike an OpenStruct.
  # 
  # @example of accessing the contents of a file reference
  # 
  #     file_resource.properties # => 
  # 
  #     { 'isa' => 'PBXFileReference',
  #       'lastKnownFileType' => 'sourcecode.c.h',
  #       'path' => IOSAppDelegate.h', 
  #       'sourceTree' => "<group>" }
  # 
  #     file_resource.isa # => 'PBXFileReference'
  #     file_resource.sourceTree # => "<group>"
  #
  # 
  # To provide additional convenience when traversing through the
  # various objects, the read-only method will check to see if the value
  # being returned matches that of a unique identifier. If it does, instead of
  # providing that identifier as a result and then having additional code to
  # perform the look up, it does it automatically.
  # 
  # @example of how this would have to been done without this indirection
  # 
  #     project = Xcode.project('MyProject')
  #     main_group = project.groups
  #     child_identifier = group.children.first
  #     subgroup = project.registry['objects'][child_identifier]
  #     
  # @example of hot this works currently because of this indirection
  # 
  #     group = Xcode.project('MyProject.xcodeproj').mainGroup
  #     subgroup = group.group('Models')
  # 
  # 
  # Next, as most every one of these objects is a Hash that contain the properties
  # instead of objects it would likely be better to encapsulate these resources
  # within specific classes that provide additional functionality. So that when 
  # a group resource or a file resource is returned you can perform unique 
  # functionality with it automatically.
  # 
  # This is done by using the 'isa' property field which contains the type of
  # content object. Instead of creating an object and encapsulating if a module
  # that matches the name of the 'isa', that module of functionality is 
  # automatically mixed-in to provide that functionality.
